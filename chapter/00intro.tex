A big part of the theory and practice of cryptography is devoted to the study of different technologies deployed in our world today. Standard topics include the task of encryption, which relates to hiding information, but it is also common to consider digital signatures and message authentication codes to ensure integrity, enable authentication and authorization, and many other subjects relevant for today’s infrastructure. For centuries, these were essentially the main tasks associated with the idea of securing information and communi- cation, and this continues being the case today—of course, with the added complications of digital and worldwide-distributed technologies. Research into correct implementations and deployments of these tools, possible attacks, improvements, enhancements in user experience, adaptation to modern more technologies and scenarios, and other relevant questions, is of high importance.
